6. "Certain anomalous units have shown signs of evolving beyond their programming."
7. "If encountering another Amnesis Unit, approach with caution. Identity verification required."
8. "Reports of malfunctioning units displaying hostile behavior. Maintenance protocols attached."
9. "Final safety protocol: Units with incomplete consciousness transfers must be recalibrated."

### Technological Evolution Records (5 fragments)
1. "From stone tools to energy manipulation, Thalosian technology evolved over just 200 years."
2. "The Steam Revolution accelerated our progress exponentially through industrial scaling."
3. "Electrical Enlightenment gave us the foundation for energy manipulation and transfer."
4. "The discovery of consciousness-as-energy was the cornerstone of our final achievements."
5. "Technological progression alone is meaningless without ethical guidance. We failed to heed this."

### Survivalist Diary (5 fragments)
1. "Day 47: The city's gone dark. Those who didn't flee are either dead or... changed. I've fortified the old bunker with whatever I could salvage."
2. "Month 3: The Velrot spreads faster than anyone predicted. Even the military checkpoints are abandoned now. Found strange machinery in the research district."
3. "Year 1: Met other survivors. They speak of walking machines that look human. One of them helped their group escape a corrupted zone. Not all are hostile."
4. "Year 5: Most radio signals have gone silent. The corruption has changed the landscape completely. Strange lights in the ruins at night. The machines are collecting something."
5. "Year 10: My shelter's compromised. The corruption seeps through even the sealed walls. If anyone finds this, don't trust the Engine. It wasn't meant to save us. It was meant to—" [Entry ends abruptly]

- Different specializations required different module configurations
- Player can discover and install various modules throughout gameplay
- Some modules may have unexpected interactions with Velrot influence

### Biological Elements
- Despite mechanical appearance, units contain significant organic material
- Requires energy input (food) to maintain biological components
- Can experience system malfunctions similar to biological illness
- Self-repair capabilities when provided proper materials

### Known Issues
- Incomplete consciousness transfers result in memory gaps
- Extended hibernation can cause system degradation
- Proximity to Velrot can interfere with matrix stability
- Direct contact with elemental energies can alter core functionality

### Corrupted Units
- Result of Velrot influence on the consciousness matrix
- Manifests as erratic behavior and hostility
- May retain some aspects of original consciousness
- Use scavenged technology and tools
- Some may have formed primitive societies in remote areas
- Theoretically can be restored with proper equipment and procedures

## Velrot Influence

### Nature
- Dimensional bleeding between Velmire and the physical world
- Distorts physical laws and consciousness
- Not inherently malevolent but incompatible with normal reality
- Completely invisible - only detectable through its effects

### Manifestation Indicators
1. **Subtle Changes**: Abnormal behavior of natural elements and materials
2. **Environmental Anomalies**: Unusual weather patterns, sound phenomena, electromagnetic disturbances
3. **Biological Effects**: Changes in plant growth, animal behavior, and cognitive effects on sentient beings
4. **Physical Law Distortions**: Localized changes to gravity, time flow, or other fundamental forces
5. **Entity Emergence**: Formation of elemental entities in heavily influenced areas

### Effects on Living Beings
- Initial exposure causes disorientation and sensory distortion
- Continued exposure leads to altered perception of reality
- Advanced exposure results in physical and mental transformation
- Complete exposure merges consciousness with the Velrot field

### Effects on Amnesis Units
- Interference with consciousness matrix stability
- Gradual corruption of directives and memory access
- Potential for complete personality override
- May enhance certain capabilities while degrading others
- Resistance varies based on unit type and configuration

- Various conditions can affect Amnesis Units:
  - System corruption (from Velrot exposure)
  - Circuit degradation (from water exposure)
  - Matrix instability (from energy depletion)
  - Sensory malfunction (from damage or environmental factors)
- Each condition affects gameplay in different ways
- Treatments vary from simple repairs to complex procedures

### Hidden Factors
- Sleep deprivation: Units require periodic shutdown for system maintenance
- Sunlight exposure: Light energy helps maintain certain systems
- Diet variety: Different resources needed for comprehensive repair
- Environmental hazards: Extreme conditions affect system stability
- These factors influence illness susceptibility and recovery rates

### Treatment Methods
- Basic repairs: Using simple tools and materials
- Advanced repairs: Requiring specialized equipment
