## Timeline of Events

### The Rise of Thalos
- **~500 Years Ago**: Thalosian civilization reaches its technological peak
- **Notable Achievements**: 
  - Creation of self-sustaining energy cores
  - Development of matter-energy conversion technology
  - First successful consciousness transfer experiments

### The Velrot Crisis
- **~300 Years Ago**: First documented case of Velrot corruption
- **~295 Years Ago**: Velrot spreads to major population centers
- **~290 Years Ago**: Crucis Engine project initiated as potential solution
- **~285 Years Ago**: Amnesis Unit program started as backup preservation plan
- **~282 Years Ago**: Crucis Engine activated, catastrophic failure occurs
- **~280 Years Ago**: Last recorded Thalosian communication

### The Silent Era (Present Day)
- **Current Time**: Approximately 280 years after Thalosian collapse
- **World State**: Largely uninhabited, dominated by natural reclamation and Velrot influence
- **Player Awakening**: Amnesis Unit activates without directive or complete memory transfer

## Key Locations

### Thalos Central Research Facility
- Primary location for Crucis Engine development
- Contains advanced laboratories and memory storage chambers
- Heavily influenced by Velrot due to proximity to the catastrophe
- Player can find critical memory fragments and engine components here

### The Archive
- Thalosian knowledge repository
- Multiple access levels requiring different security clearances
- Contains records of early Velrot research and warnings about the Crucis Engine
- Located in a remote mountain range, partially shielded from Velrot influence

### The Nexus
- Central node of the Thalosian power grid
- Connected to major facilities via underground conduits
- Still contains active but unstable energy cores
- Required to power the reconstructed Crucis Engine

### The Vaults
- Six sealed elemental containment chambers
- Each houses a concentrated form of elemental energy
- Became focal points of Velrot influence, birthing the elemental bosses
- Scattered across different biomes and depths

### Velmire
- Parallel dimension that is the source of Velrot
- Alien landscape with unique physics and materials
- Home to pure elemental entities before corruption
- Contains the true solution to stopping Velrot influence

## Key Characters

### Dr. Elian Thorus
- Lead scientist on the Amnesis Unit project
- Intended consciousness donor for the player's Amnesis Unit
- Left fragmented messages and warnings throughout the world
- His consciousness transfer was interrupted, resulting in the player's incomplete memories

### Director Valia Nex
- Head of the Crucis Engine project
- Believed the Engine would purify Velrot influence
- Ignored warnings about potential dimensional instability
- Her research logs reveal growing obsession and deteriorating mental state

### Archivist Caelan
- Responsible for documenting Velrot research
- Created a hidden archive of uncensored information
- Left encoded messages for future survivors
- Suspected the true nature of Velrot before others

### The Six Wardens
- Specialized Amnesis Units tasked with monitoring the elemental vaults
- Each bonded with their respective element for enhanced capabilities
- Affected by Velrot during the catastrophe
- Now manifest as the six elemental bosses

## Memory Fragments

*Memory fragments are collectible items that reveal lore when found. Each numbered fragment belongs to a sequence that tells a complete story.*

### Dr. Thorus' Personal Logs (10 fragments)
1. "Initial testing of consciousness transfer successful with simple memories."
2. "The Amnesis Units show promise, but complete transfer remains elusive."
3. "Director Nex pushes forward with the Crucis Engine despite our concerns."
4. "Velrot presence increasing near the research facility. Staff reporting odd dreams."
5. "Something about the Velrot seems almost... sentient in its influence patterns."
6. "The dimensional readings from Vault Six are troubling. Possible breach detected."
7. "I've prepared this unit—Unit #437—for my own consciousness if the worst happens."
8. "The Engine test is tomorrow. I've hidden backup data in the old maintenance tunnels."
9. "Emergency protocol initiated. Transfer beginning but facility power fluctuating."
10. "If you're experiencing these memories, I failed to complete the transfer. Find the Archive."

### Crucis Engine Documents (8 fragments)
1. "Project Crucis: A dimensional purification system to eradicate Velrot at its source."
2. "The Engine harnesses elemental energy to create a focused dimensional aperture."
3. "Initial simulations show 87% effectiveness at neutralizing Velrot influence."
4. "Warning: Unexplained energy recursion detected in prototype tests."
5. "Dimensional stability calculations show potential for feedback loop. Requires review."
6. "Director Nex has overridden safety protocol concerns. Project accelerated."
7. "Final Engine configuration requires simultaneous activation of all six elemental cores."
8. "Emergency: Engine activation has inverted the purification matrix. Containment failing."

### Archivist Records (7 fragments)
1. "Official Velrot documentation redacted by order of Central Authority."
2. "Independent analysis suggests Velrot is not a disease but a dimensional bleed."
3. "Ancient texts reference similar phenomena occurring centuries ago, called 'The Veil Thinning.'"
4. "The correlation between Velrot influence and dimensional research is being ignored."
5. "I've hidden uncensored records in maintenance sector 7B, access code 3479."
6. "Velmire is not just another dimension—it may be the mirror of our own."
7. "The key is not to destroy the Velrot but to restore balance between dimensions."

## Velrot Influence

### Nature
- Dimensional bleeding between Velmire and the physical world
- Distorts physical laws and consciousness
- Not inherently malevolent but incompatible with normal reality
- Completely invisible - only detectable through its effects

### Manifestation Indicators
1. **Subtle Changes**: Abnormal behavior of natural elements and materials
2. **Environmental Anomalies**: Unusual weather patterns, sound phenomena, electromagnetic disturbances
3. **Biological Effects**: Changes in plant growth, animal behavior, and cognitive effects on sentient beings
4. **Physical Law Distortions**: Localized changes to gravity, time flow, or other fundamental forces
5. **Entity Emergence**: Formation of elemental entities in heavily influenced areas

### Effects on Living Beings
- Initial exposure causes disorientation and sensory distortion
- Continued exposure leads to altered perception of reality
- Advanced exposure results in physical and mental transformation
- Complete exposure merges consciousness with the Velrot field
