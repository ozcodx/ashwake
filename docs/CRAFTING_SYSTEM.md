## Core Crafting Principles

### Realism and Complexity
- Crafting in Ashwake aims for a balance between realism and playability
- Multi-stage processes reflect real-world manufacturing
- Tool quality and player skill affect crafting outcomes
- Environmental factors influence certain crafting processes

### Knowledge Requirements
- Players must discover recipes through:
  - Experimentation
  - Finding documentation/blueprints
  - Learning from memory fragments
  - Reverse engineering existing items
- Knowledge is persistent once learned

### Resource Economy
- Resources have varying:
  - Rarity
  - Geographic distribution
  - Processing requirements
  - Quality levels
- Resource depletion and renewal systems encourage exploration
- Some crafting processes produce byproducts or waste
