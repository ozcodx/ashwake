Wooden Bucket mod [bucket_wooden]

This mod is simple. It adds a bucket made of wood. Wooden buckets can hold only water or river water, not lava. This bucket lets you start farming before you find any iron.

If you use the mods Ethereal NG [ethereal] and/or Farming Redo [farming], their bowl recipes are changed so as not to conflict with the bucket recipe: 3 wood blocks -> bucket -> 4 bowls.

Changelog:

- 1.0   - Initial release. Wooden bucket of water is not in the group:water_bucket, to prevent getting an empty iron bucket when using a wooden bucket of water in recipes. farming:bowl and ethereal:bowl are crafted from wooden buckets.
- 1.0.1 - Mod renamed to bucket\_wooden because the name "wooden_bucket" is already taken by viewtopic.php?t=16472
- 1.0.2 - Refined conditions for bowl recipe. Added "Wooden" to bucket names, and intllib support.
